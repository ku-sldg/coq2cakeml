HAVE:
   [PARAM1, PARAM2, PARAM3, arg1, arg2, ... argn, TYPE]
 OR
  [argn, ..., arg2, arg1, PARAMm, ... PARAM1], TYPE


WANT:
  arg1 -> arg2 -> ... -> argn -> RESULT_TYPE

NEED TO UNDERSTAND:
  any arg might have the type of a PARAM and is indexed by DeBruijn number

NEED TO USE:
  PARAMS and RESULT_TYPE are mkRels
  PARAMS are base 0,1, so that's easy
  RESULT_TYPE is #PARAMS+1

 - index (within constructor)
 - index (which constructor/within type)
 - number of PARAMs
 - 1 for mat, 1 for RESULT_TYPE, 1 for RESULT_TYPE_INV
 -

taking the second representation,

List.chop #args rep = (x,_)
